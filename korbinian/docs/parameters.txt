    uniprot_folder_sel : str
        Path to uniprot/selected folder.
    list_number : int
        List number (e.g. 8), determining the input and output files.
    selected_uniprot_records_flatfile : str
        Path to output UniProt flatfile of selected records. E.g. List08_selected_uniprot_records_flatfile.txt
    logging : logging.Logger
        Logger for printing to console and logfile.
    OMPdb_summary_nr_csv : str
        Path to input csv with OMP sequences and membrane annotation
    OMPdb_summary_csv_with_TM_seqs : str
        Path to output csv with the sliced TM sequences
    input_accession_list : list
        List of accessions.
    uniprot_dir : str
        Path to UniProt folder, where selected_uniprot_records_flatfile will be saved
    list_number : int
        List number used to determine the output filename.
    logging : logging.Logger
        Logger for printing to console and logfile.
    fig_nr : int
        Figure number (canvas number). Used to save Fig01, Fig02 etc, each with 4 plots (e.g. for 4 TMDs)
    fig : matplotlib.figure
        Figure (canvas) object, containing plots for AAIMON of up to 4 TMDs.
    axarr : array
        Array used to select the plots in the figure object. E.g. axarr[0,0] refers to the plot on the top left.
    df_cr : pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe with conservation ratios for a particular TMD (or region).
    TMD : str
        String denoting transmembrane domain number (e.g. "TM01")
    binlist : list
        List of bins used for the histogram.
    zipout : zipfile.Zipfile handle
        Handle for zipfile, open for writing.
    row_nr : int
        Row number in Figure canvas. E.g. when row_nr & col_nr are both 0, the axarr[row_nr, col_nr] is axarr[0, 0], which refers to the plot on the top left.
    col_nr : int
        Column number in Figure canvas. E.g. when row_nr & col_nr are both 0, the axarr[row_nr, col_nr] is axarr[0, 0], which refers to the plot on the top left.
    fontsize : int
        Fontsize in plots.
    savefig : bool
        Whether the figure/canvas needs to be saved. Since there are 4 plots in each figure, this is True for every 4th plot (4th fig_nr).
