    Parameters
    ----------
    p : dict
        Protein Dictionary. Contains all input settings, sequences and filepaths related to a single protein.
        Protein-specific data is extracted from one row of the the list summary, e.g. List05_summary.csv, which is read as df.
        p also contains the GENERAL korbinian settings and filepaths for that list (pathdict, s, logging)

        Components of p :
            pathdict : dict
                Dictionary of the key paths and files associated with that List number.
            s : dict
                Settings dictionary extracted from excel settings file.
            logging : logging.Logger
                Logger for printing to console and/or logfile.
                If multiprocessing == True, logging.info etc will only print to console.
            p : protein-specific dictionary components
                acc, list_of_TMDs, description, TM01_seq, etc
    Returns
    -------
    In all cases, a tuple (str, bool, str) is returned.

    if successful:
        return acc, True, "0"
    if not successful:
        return acc, False, "specific warning or reason why protein failed"



    homol_df_orig_zip : zipfile
        Zipfile containing the following:
            SIMAP_align_pretty_csv : csv
                CSV file containing the hit_number protein description and the pretty alignment for each homologue
            homol_df_orig_pickle : pickled pd.DataFrame
                Dataframe containing all sequence extracted from the XML file.
                This can be large, as it contains the full query, markup and match sequences




    uniprot_dir : str
        Path to databases/uniprot folder.
    list_number : int
        List number (e.g. 8), determining the input and output files.
    selected_uniprot_records_flatfile : str
        Path to output UniProt flatfile of selected records. E.g. List08_selected_uniprot_records_flatfile.txt
    logging : logging.Logger
        Logger for printing to console and logfile.
    OMPdb_list_csv : str
        Path to input csv with OMP sequences and membrane annotation
    list_csv : str
        Path to output csv with the sliced TM sequences
    input_accession_list : list
        List of accessions.
    uniprot_dir : str
        Path to UniProt folder, where selected_uniprot_records_flatfile will be saved
    list_number : int
